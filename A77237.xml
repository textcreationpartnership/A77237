            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>To climbe their Climes, I have nor ſtrength, nor skill,</l>

               <l>But by my humble hand thus rudely pen'd</l>

               <l>How hot, and dry, contend with moiſt, and cold,</l>
               <l>How Aire, and Earth, no correſpondence hold,</l>
               <l>And yet in equall tempers, how they gree,</l>
               <l>How divers natures, make one unity.</l>
               <l>Some thing of all (though mean) I did intend,</l>
               <l>But fear'd you'ld judge, one <hi>Bartas</hi> was my friend,</l>
               <l>I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth,</l>

               <l>TO ſing of Wars, of Captaines, and of Kings,</l>
               <l>Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,</l>
               <l>For my mean Pen, are too ſuperiour things,</l>
               <l>And how they all, or each, their dates have run:</l>
               <l>Let Poets, and Hiſtorians ſet theſe forth,</l>

               <l>Foole, <hi>I</hi> doe grudge, the Muſes did not part</l>

               <l>From School-boyes tongue, no Rhethorick we expect,</l>

               <l>My fooliſh, broken, blemiſh'd Muſe ſo ſings;</l>

               <l>Art can doe much, but this maxime's moſt ſure,</l>

                  <l>AH me! conceiv'd in ſin, and born in ſorrow,</l>
                  <l>A nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow.</l>

                  <l>My mothers breeding ſicknes, I will ſpare;</l>

                  <l>To tel that paine, which cann't be told by tongue;</l>
                  <l>With tears into this world I did arrive;</l>
                  <l>My mother ſtil did waſte, as I did thrive:</l>
                  <l>Who yet with love, and all alacrity,</l>
                  <l>Spending was willing, to be ſpent for me;</l>
                  <l>With wayward cryes, I did diſturbe her reſt;</l>

                  <l>When Infancy was paſt, my Childiſhneſſe,</l>
                  <l>Did act al folly, that it could expreſſe.</l>
                  <l>My ſillineſſe did only take delight,</l>

                  <l>My high-borne ſoule, ſo ſtraitly was confin'd:</l>

                  <l>This little houſe of fleſh, did ſpacious count:</l>
                  <l>Through ignorance, all troubles did ſurmount.</l>
                  <l>Yet this advantage, had mine ignorance,</l>

                  <l>How to be rich, or great, I did not carke;</l>

                  <l>With coſtly preſents, or baſe flattery.</l>
                  <l>No office coveted, wherein I might</l>
                  <l>Make ſtrong my ſelfe, and turne aſide weak right.</l>
                  <l>No malice bare, to this, or that great Peer,</l>
                  <l>Nor unto buzzing whiſperors, gave ear.</l>
                  <l>I gave no hand, nor vote, for death, or life:</l>

                  <l>My quarrells, not for Diadems did riſe;</l>
                  <l>But for an Apple, Plumbe, or ſome ſuch prize,</l>
                  <l>My ſtroks did cauſe no death, nor wounds, nor skars.</l>
                  <l>My little wrath did ceaſe ſoon as my wars.</l>
                  <l>My duel was no challenge, nor did ſeek.</l>
                  <l>My foe ſhould weltering, with his bowels reek.</l>
                  <l>I had no Suits at law, neighbours to vex.</l>
                  <l>Nor evidence for land, did me perplex.</l>
                  <l>I fear'd no ſtormes, nor al the windes that blows,</l>
                  <l>I had no ſhips at Sea, no fraughts to looſe.</l>

                  <l>Nor yet on future things did place my hope.</l>
                  <l>This was mine innocence, but oh the ſeeds,</l>

                  <l>But yet let me relate, before I go,</l>
                  <l>The ſins, and dangers I am ſubject to.</l>
                  <l>From birth ſtayned, with <hi>Adams</hi> ſinfull fact;</l>
                  <l>From thence I 'gan to ſin, as ſoon as act.</l>
                  <l>A perverſe will, a love to what's forbid:</l>
                  <l>A ſerpents ſling in pleaſing face lay hid.</l>
                  <l>A lying tongue as ſoon as it could ſpeak,</l>
                  <l>And fift Commandement do daily break.</l>
                  <l>Oft ſtubborn, peeviſh, ſullen, pout, and cry:</l>
                  <l>Then nought can pleaſe, and yet I know not why.</l>
                  <l>As many was my ſins, ſo dangers too:</l>
                  <l>For ſin brings ſorrow, ſickneſſe, death, and woe.</l>
                  <l>And though I miſſe, the toſſings of the mind:</l>
                  <l>Yet griefs, in my fraile fleſh, I ſtill do find.</l>
                  <l>What gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain?</l>

                  <l>What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have?</l>
                  <l>And ſome perhaps, I carry to my grave.</l>
                  <l>Some times in fire, ſometimes in waters fall:</l>
                  <l>Strangely preſerv'd, yet mind it not at all.</l>
                  <l>At home, abroad, my danger's manifold.</l>

               <l>Where is the man can ſay, lo, I have found</l>
               <l>On brittle earth, a conſolation ſound?</l>
               <l>What is 't in honour, to be ſet on high?</l>
               <l>No, they like beaſts, and ſonnes of men ſhall die,</l>
               <l>And whilſt they live, how oft doth turn their State?</l>
               <l>He's now a ſlave, that was a Prince of late.</l>
               <l>What is't in wealth, great treaſures for to gain?</l>
               <l>No, that's but labour anxious, care and pain.</l>
               <l>He heaps up riches, and he heaps up ſorrow,</l>
               <l>Its his to day, but who 's his heire to morrow?</l>
               <l>What then? content in pleaſures canſt thou find?</l>
               <l>More vain then all, that's but to graſp the wind.</l>
               <l>The ſenſuall ſenſes for a time they pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Mean while the conſcience rage, who ſhall appeaſe?</l>

               <l>They'r foul enough to day, that once was fair,</l>
               <l>What, Is't in flowring youth, or manly age?</l>
               <l>The firſt is prone to vice, the laſt to rage.</l>
               <l>Where is it then? in wiſdome, learning, arts?</l>
               <l>Sure if on earth, it muſt be in thoſe parts;</l>
               <l>Yet theſe, the wiſeſt man of men did find,</l>
               <l>But vanity, vexation of the mind,</l>
               <l>And he that knows the moſt doth ſtill bemoan,</l>
               <l>He knows not all, that here is to be known,</l>
               <l>What is it then? to do as Stoicks tell,</l>
