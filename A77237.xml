            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,</l>
               <l>For my mean Pen, are too Å¿uperiour things,</l>
               <l>And how they all, or each, their dates have run:</l>
               <l>Let Poets, and HiÅ¿torians Å¿et theÅ¿e forth,</l>

               <l>Art can doe much, but this maxime's moÅ¿t Å¿ure,</l>

               <l>A Poets Pen, all Å¿corne, I Å¿hould thus wrong;</l>

               <head>Of the vanity of all worldly creatures.</head>
               <l>AS he Å¿aid vanity, Å¿o vain Å¿ay I,</l>
               <l>O vanity, O vain all under skie,</l>
               <l>Where is the man can Å¿ay, lo, I have found</l>
               <l>On brittle earth, a conÅ¿olation Å¿ound?</l>
               <l>What is 't in honour, to be Å¿et on high?</l>
               <l>No, they like beaÅ¿ts, and Å¿onnes of men Å¿hall die,</l>
               <l>And whilÅ¿t they live, how oft doth turn their State?</l>
               <l>He's now a Å¿lave, that was a Prince of late.</l>
               <l>What is't in wealth, great treaÅ¿ures for to gain?</l>
               <l>No, that's but labour anxious, care and pain.</l>
               <l>He heaps up riches, and he heaps up Å¿orrow,</l>
               <l>Its his to day, but who 's his heire to morrow?</l>
               <l>What then? content in pleaÅ¿ures canÅ¿t thou find?</l>
               <l>More vain then all, that's but to graÅ¿p the wind.</l>
               <l>The Å¿enÅ¿uall Å¿enÅ¿es for a time they pleaÅ¿e,</l>
               <l>Mean while the conÅ¿cience rage, who Å¿hall appeaÅ¿e?</l>
               <l>What is't in beauty? no, that's but a Å¿nare,</l>
               <l>They'r foul enough to day, that once was fair,</l>
               <l>What, Is't in flowring youth, or manly age?</l>
               <l>The firÅ¿t is prone to vice, the laÅ¿t to rage.</l>
               <l>Where is it then? in wiÅ¿dome, learning, arts?</l>
               <l>Sure if on earth, it muÅ¿t be in thoÅ¿e parts;</l>
               <l>Yet theÅ¿e, the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t man of men did find,</l>
               <l>But vanity, vexation of the mind,</l>
               <l>And he that knows the moÅ¿t doth Å¿till bemoan,</l>
               <l>He knows not all, that here is to be known,</l>
               <l>What is it then? to do as Stoicks tell,</l>
               <l>Nor laugh, nor weep, let things go ill or well<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

               <l>Such Å¿toicks are but Å¿tocks, Å¿uch teaching vain:</l>
               <l>While man is man, he Å¿hall have eaÅ¿e or pain.</l>
               <l>If not in honour, beauty, age, nor treaÅ¿ure,</l>
               <l>Nor yet in learning, wiÅ¿dome, youth nor pleaÅ¿ure?</l>
               <l>Where Å¿hall I climbe, Å¿ound, Å¿eek, Å¿earch or find,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Å¿ummum Bonum</hi> which may Å¿tay my mind?</l>
               <l>There is a path, no vultures eye hath Å¿een.</l>
               <l>Where lions fierce, nor lions whelps hath been,</l>
               <l>Which leads unto that living ChriÅ¿tall fount,</l>
               <l>Who drinks thereof, the world doth naught account.</l>
               <l>The depth, and Å¿ea, hath Å¿aid its not in me,</l>
               <l>With pearl and gold it Å¿hall not valued be:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Saphyre, Onix, Topas,</hi> who will change,</l>
               <l>Its hid from eyes of men, they count it Å¿trange,</l>
               <l>Death and deÅ¿truction, the fame hath heard,</l>
               <l>But where, and what it is, from heaven's declar'd,</l>
               <l>It brings to honour, which Å¿hall not decay,</l>
               <l>It Å¿teeres with wealth, which time cann't wear away.</l>
               <l>It yeeldeth pleaÅ¿ures, faire beyond conceit,</l>
               <l>And truly beautifies without deceit.</l>
               <l>Nor Å¿trength nor wiÅ¿dome, nor freÅ¿h youth Å¿hall fade,</l>
               <l>Nor death Å¿hall Å¿ee, but are immortall made,</l>
               <l>This pearl of price, this tree of life, this Å¿pring,</l>
               <l>Who is poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of, Å¿hall reign a King.</l>
